Generate a project snapshot of the current working directory.

Run the snapshot script:
```
python3 /home/smlflg/.claude/scripts/snapshot.py
```

After reviewing the output:
1. Summarize the key findings (main language, project type, notable configs)
2. Identify any potential issues (missing README, no tests, large untracked files)
3. Ask the user what they'd like to focus on
