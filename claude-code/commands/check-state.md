Before making ANY changes, perform these checks and report findings:

1. Run `pwd` and confirm working directory
2. Run `ls -la` to see current files and folder structure
3. Run `tree -L 2 --dirsfirst` to get a visual overview (if tree is available)
4. Run `git status && git branch -a` if inside a git repo
5. Check for existing config files, READMEs, or project manifests (package.json, setup.py, pyproject.toml, Makefile)
6. Summarize what exists BEFORE proposing any changes
7. Ask the user to confirm your understanding is correct before proceeding

Do NOT skip any of these steps. Do NOT start writing code or making changes until the user confirms.
