Research a topic using Gemini via MCP for deep web search and analysis.

## Task: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps:

1. **Formulate research questions**: Based on the user's request, create 2-3 specific search queries

2. **Use Gemini MCP**: Call the `ask-gemini` MCP tool with the research query.
   - Gemini has a massive context window — good for analyzing large docs
   - Use the @file syntax to reference local files for context if needed

3. **Cross-reference**: If the topic is technical:
   - Also use Claude's native WebSearch for a second perspective
   - Compare findings from both sources

4. **Synthesize**: Present findings in a clear format:
   - **Summary** (2-3 sentences)
   - **Key findings** (bullet points)
   - **Sources** (links)
   - **Recommendation** (if applicable)

## Fallback:
If the Gemini MCP server is not responding within 60 seconds:
- Fall back to Claude's native WebSearch and WebFetch
- Tell the user: "Gemini MCP not responding — using native web search instead."

## Important:
- Always cite sources
- Distinguish between facts and opinions
- Note if information might be outdated
